                            <h5>Lead Project Engineer</h5><br>
                            <p>Last year, Hasbro partnered with Indiegogo for the first annual crowdfunding gaming challenge, where we asked game designers to submit ideas for the next big face-to-face part game. The Mr. Toast Game created by Dan Goodsell came out on top after having raised over $10,000 and 200 supporters on Indiegogo. The grand prize: $10,000 and a trip to Hasbro to partner with our development team to produce the game for real. This is when my team met Dan and went to work.</p>
                            <p>As a member of the development team working with Dan on The Mr. Toast Game, I was part of an interdisciplinary group composed of Marketers, Graphic Designers, Product Designers, and Packaging Engineers. As a team, we met daily to discuss how we could both optimize the product offering, while still making the project a profitable endeavor. As the lead Project Engineer, it was my responsibility to determine the cost to make one complete product. This involved learning the components of Dan's game, calculating all material, manufacturing, and labor costs to determine the game’s full financial picture, and communicating with our manufacturing team in China to get an initial cost estimate. However, as is common in the early stages of design, the costs provided yielded unacceptable profit margins, forcing us to brainstorm ways we could streamline our budget. There were many ways to do this including limiting the numbers of components, changing the material of components, reducing the number of print colors or print faces, etc. This process took several months but in the end we had a product and a price with which we were satisfied. Once costs were confirmed, and the game’s artwork finalized, the game’s development stage was nearly complete. By the time I left Hasbro, the company was just starting production of the game, and this August when I was school shopping in Target, there was The Mr. Toast Game sitting on the shelf. Now that was one cool feeling.</p>
                            <p>The Mr. Toast Game is just one example of the many products for which I served as the lead Project Engineer while at Hasbro. Unfortunately, the rest of these items are slotted to hit shelves during the 2017 year. While each project brought its own unique challenges and characteristics, the main development cycle was very similar to that of Mr. Toast. My work on this project was recognized by my colleagues, and I continued to see an increase in my responsibility on the Gaming Team. By the end of my time at Hasbro, I was working as the Project Engineer on nineteen different items. Through the role of Project Engineer at Hasbro, I learned technical skills in materials, manufacturing, and product development. I also gained equally important career skills like organization, communication and professionalism that are imperative for succeeding in my future career in mechanical engineering and product design.</p>

                                <h5>Project Manager and Lead Design Engineer</h5><br>
                                <p>As a coop at Hasbro, you are typically only there for six months and therefore only get to see snapshots of different parts of the development cycle. To combat this, Hasbro offers the EPIC project: a chance for coops to participate in an expedited development process where we are tasked with taking a product from ideation or creation, culminating in a final presentation to Senior Management where we get to present our work.</p>
                                <p>My EPIC team consisted of six coops. Our majors included Electrical, Industrial, Mechanical, and Package Engineering. I was given the role of handling the design of our game and the organizing of weekly meetings. I jumped on these two responsibilities because they are outside the tasks for my everyday job and I had a particular interest in product design.</p>
                                <p>We started with about a month of researching what makes a product successful in  the Toy and Game industry. These insights were key as began to brainstorm dozens of possibilities for profit opportunities. As we narrowed our list, and began to develop our best ideas further, I made many of the sketches and 3D models to help us have a visual perspective on the product we were ideating. Once chosen, our product went through several rounds of designs. This was great design experience for me as I was able to greatly improve my SolidWorks and prototyping skills. During this project, our team encountered several challenges: We were given a max price that we could sell the product at retail. This mean we had a limited amount a money to put into the fabrication of the product in order for it to be profitable. Many of our ideas were scratched because they did not meet this parameter. We also were challenged when fabricating our functioning prototype. It was here that I learned how to solder, draft screw holes, and assemble a multi-part product. </p>
                                <p>CONCLUSION: After about four months of these revisions, we had created a game that included LED lights, an LCD screen, batteries, and five plastic housing components to hold it all in place. We were able not only present the consumer insights, financial story, and development process for our game, but we were able to play it with the crowd as well!</p>
