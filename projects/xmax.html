          <p class="wow fadeInUp" style="text-align:justify;">The inspiration for this project came from one of my friends, Dylan, who was the manager for the varsity men’s basketball team at Northeastern. He would attend practices and games, and spend time with another one of the team’s active attendants,
            Max. Max is an 18-year-old who loves sports and sits on the bench with the team at their home games. Max also has cerebral palsy and has extremely limited mobility in his arms and legs. This does not hold Max back in the slightest; however,
            there are many things that Max would love to do but is not able to because of his condition. One of those is playing XBOX. Dylan, a fellow mechanical engineering student, realized the potential to make this wish a reality. The XMAX Project
            was launched with the goal of creating a solution designed for Max to play XBOX.

            <li>Our first step was to learn about Max’s strengths, mobility, and expectations for this device. Through interviews with his father and physical therapist, we found that Max had the most mobility in his head, and his neck was by far his strongest
              muscle.</li>
            <li>By transforming the information collected from interviews into constraints, we developed a prototype designed around Max’s strengths. Four buttons were to sit around Max’s head, and enlarged analog sticks were fixed to the arms of his chair
              such that he could use his entire shoulder instead of articulating his thumbs.</li>

            <li>The first generation of the XMAX controller was completed in the spring of 2017. This consisted of a PVC frame that hooked to the back of Max’s wheelchair. Using GoPro mounts, mechanical buttons were assembled to sit around Max’s head, simulating
              the A, X, B, and Y buttons on an XBOX controller.</li>
            <li>We delivered the controller to Max and conducted user testing alongside his physical therapist. The concept solution showed significant promise, and Max threw his first touchdown pass. We also came away with key insights that would drive the
              next iteration of the device.</li>

            <li>The second generation XMAX controller was completed in the spring of 2018. It included a more robust aluminum frame, modular buttons with flexible linkages for adjusting their position around Max’s head, and a companion controller so that
              another person could help Max play if he got stuck. </li>
            <li>This improvement involved hard wiring the A, X, B, and Y buttons on the XBOX controller to the “breakout” companion controller. Connector pins were used to wire this companion controller to the buttons on the XMAX device. Doing this allows
              for another person to have full functionality of the XBOX controller if Max needs help.</li>

            <li>This decision was made after significant testing with Max. It was clear that while enabling Max to play XBOX was the ultimate goal, this would need to be taken in stages. The enlarged analog sticks on the first prototype did not provide the
              easy articulation we had hoped. We decided it was equally important to prioritize XMAX’s functionality and Max’s engagement. Therefore, by simplifying the XMAX device to the four main buttons, we simplified Max’s responsibilities while still
              allowing him to be in control of the game.</li>

            <li>This project has allowed me to bring many of the product development skills I learned on coop to campus and work with a team of students to achieve a common goal. From a technical engineering side, I’ve gained experience with PCB and arduino
              integration, soldering and housing electronics, and human factors engineering in designing a product that would suit Max’s needs. Additionally, I’ve found a project that directly improves the life of an individual, coupling my passions for
              engineering design and social change. This process has taught me that these are the types of projects I hope to be involved in throughout my career.</li>
            <li>Not only will this device enable Max to play XBOX, but it can also be seen (especially by his therapist) as a tool to help Max gain more mobility, strengthen his muscles, and have fun while doing it. Click on the video below to see Max throw
              one of his first touchdowns!</li>
